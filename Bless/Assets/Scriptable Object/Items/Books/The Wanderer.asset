    me my and my little brother were having fun and suddnly an green monster came
    to our village with rage and was smashing everything in his way my little brother
    and i were freezed because of the shock and fear and the monster was running
    by this way but, something was off it was like as if he saw a monster, destroying
    everything in his way just to run from it; as he was getting closer and closer
    i hugged my little brother and closed my eyes then i i heared a cutting sound
    and i relaized that the sound of the running monster has stoped, i opened my
    eyes to see what happened an then the green monster just fell on his face and
    it was horryfing, then a sound got me out of the shock "You Okay?" i looked up
    and there was a man wearing a long and brown cloak with a long and thin sword
    on his back, "I''am fine thanks" after looking at the monster for one more time
    i asked him if he was the one who saven us, "You can say it" i thanked him and
    asked him if there is something we can do for him, "Then let me sleep in your
    house for this night thats all i need".

    the next day when i woke up he was
    gone, my brother asked me if he is going to come againg looks like he liked him,
    he sayd that the man walked on the monster back while he was dragging his sword
    from the back of the monster cutting it in half, i didn''t put much attention
    on the monster because i was so scared, i hope that the man is allright.'
